This documentation
------------------

Documentation is also available in docstrings provided with the code.

The examples assume ``queueing_tool`` has been imported as ``qt`` using the
following command::

    >>> import queueing_tool as qt

We also use numpy and graph-tool, which were imported with:

    >>> import graph_tool.all as gt
    >>> import numpy as np

Code snippets are indicated by three greater-than signs, such as the above
code snippets.
